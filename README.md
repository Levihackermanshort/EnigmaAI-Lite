Okay, let's outline a simplified, yet still capable, version of Enigma AI. This will focus on core functionalities while reducing complexity. We'll call it "Enigma AI Lite."

Focus: Answering factual questions and providing simple summaries.

Limitations Compared to the Full Enigma AI:

Limited Domain Knowledge: Smaller pre-trained knowledge base, focused on common topics.
Simplified NLP: Less sophisticated language understanding; handles simple, direct questions better than complex, nuanced ones.
Restricted Internet Access: Only uses a single, reliable search API (e.g., Google Custom Search) for information retrieval, instead of multiple sources.
No Personalization: No user profiles or customized responses.
Basic Summarization: Uses simple text summarization techniques.
No Real-time Data Feeds: No access to live data like stock prices or weather (though can search for it).
No Web Scraping: Avoids web scraping entirely for simplicity and ethical reasons.
Minimal Conversational Memory: Limited ability to remember past turns in the conversation.
English Language Only: No translation capabilities.
Core Components:

User Interface:

A simple text-based interface (e.g., a basic web form or command-line interface). No need for fancy graphics or complex interactions.
NLP Module:

Uses a pre-trained NLP library (e.g., SpaCy, NLTK) for basic tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.
A simplified intent classifier (e.g., using rule-based patterns or a basic machine learning model like a Naive Bayes classifier) to identify the type of question being asked (e.g., "Who is X?", "What is X?", "Tell me about X?").
Knowledge Retrieval Module:

Local Knowledge: A small, curated knowledge base (e.g., a dictionary or a simple database) containing information on common topics.
Search API: Uses Google Custom Search API (or a similar service) to query the internet for relevant information. This requires an API key. Important: Google Custom Search API has associated costs.
Response Generation Module:

If the answer is found in the local knowledge base, it is returned directly.
If the question requires internet search:
The top search results are parsed.
A simple summarization technique is applied to the search result snippets (e.g., extracting key sentences based on keyword matching).
A concise answer is generated from the summary. If the search result snippet is very short, it can be returned directly.
If no relevant results are found, a "I'm sorry, I don't have information on that topic" message is returned.
Ethical Considerations (Simplified):

Bias Awareness: Include a disclaimer that the chatbot's responses are based on information found online and may contain biases.
Source Citation: Whenever possible, include a link to the source of the information.
Disclaimer: A clear statement that the chatbot is for informational purposes only and should not be used for critical decision-making.
Example Implementation (Conceptual - Python):

import requests
import re
# Simplified Intent Classifier (Rule-based)
def classify_intent(query):
  if re.search(r"(who is|who was)", query, re.IGNORECASE):
    return "WHO_IS"
  elif re.search(r"(what is|what was)", query, re.IGNORECASE):
    return "WHAT_IS"
  elif re.search(r"(tell me about)", query, re.IGNORECASE):
      return "TELL_ME_ABOUT"
  else:
    return "UNKNOWN"

# Mock Local Knowledge Base
knowledge_base = {
    "Albert Einstein": "A brilliant physicist known for the theory of relativity.",
    "Paris": "The capital of France, famous for its Eiffel Tower.",
    "Python": "A versatile programming language."
}

def get_answer(query):
    intent = classify_intent(query)

    if intent == "WHO_IS" or intent == "WHAT_IS" or intent == "TELL_ME_ABOUT":
      # Check Local Knowledge Base first (very basic)
      for entity, answer in knowledge_base.items():
        if entity.lower() in query.lower():
          return answer + " (Source: Local Knowledge)"
    # If not found, use search API - MOCK - needs API key and handling
      else:
          # REPLACE WITH ACTUAL API CALL
          results = ["Result 1 - dummy test for web search"]
          if results:
              return "From web search: " + results[0]
          else:
              return "Not found"

    else:
      return "I am sorry, I don't understand the request."


# Example Usage
user_query = "Tell me about Paris"
answer = get_answer(user_query)
print(answer)

user_query = "Who is Obama?"
answer = get_answer(user_query)
print(answer)
Key Simplifications and Justification:

Rule-based Intent Classification: Instead of a complex machine learning model, simple regular expressions are used to identify the intent of the user's query. This reduces the need for training data and complex algorithms.
Limited Local Knowledge: A small, manually curated knowledge base is used to store information on common topics. This avoids the need for a large, pre-trained language model.
Single Search API: Using a single, reliable search API (like Google Custom Search) simplifies the information retrieval process and reduces the risk of encountering unreliable sources. (Note: You need to manage API key and costs.)
No Web Scraping: Avoiding web scraping eliminates the ethical and technical challenges associated with it.
English Only: Focusing on a single language simplifies the NLP pipeline.
Deployment:

This simplified version could be deployed as a simple web application using a framework like Flask or Django (Python). It could also be integrated into a messaging platform using their API.

Advantages of this Simplified Approach:

Faster Development: Requires less code and fewer complex algorithms.
Lower Cost: Requires less computing power and less data.
Easier to Maintain: Simpler code is easier to understand and debug.
More Controllable: Easier to ensure accuracy and avoid spreading misinformation.
Important Considerations:

Accuracy of Search Results: The quality of the chatbot's responses depends heavily on the accuracy of the search results. It's important to choose a reliable search API and to carefully parse and summarize the results.
API Costs: Be aware of the costs associated with using search APIs.
Security: Protect your API keys and ensure that your application is secure.
Scalability: Consider the scalability of your application if you expect a large number of users.
This "Enigma AI Lite" approach provides a practical way to create a functional chatbot with internet connectivity without the complexity and resource requirements of a full-fledged AI system. It's a good starting point for exploring the possibilities of AI-powered information retrieval and natural language processing. Remember to prioritize ethical considerations and responsible use of technology.


Okay, let's outline a practical development and deployment plan for "Enigma AI Lite" using Python and Flask. I'll provide code snippets and instructions, keeping it as simple and clear as possible. This outline assumes you have basic Python knowledge and have Python installed on your system.

Phase 1: Setup and Dependencies

Install Python: Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
Install Dependencies:
pip install Flask requests beautifulsoup4
Flask: A lightweight web framework.
requests: For making HTTP requests (to the search API).
beautifulsoup4: For parsing HTML from search results.
Phase 2: Code Development (app.py)

from flask import Flask, request, render_template
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import re  #For intent classification

app = Flask(__name__)

# --- Intent Classification (Simplified) ---
def classify_intent(query):
  if re.search(r"(who is|who was)", query, re.IGNORECASE):
    return "WHO_IS"
  elif re.search(r"(what is|what was)", query, re.IGNORECASE):
    return "WHAT_IS"
  elif re.search(r"(tell me about)", query, re.IGNORECASE):
      return "TELL_ME_ABOUT"
  else:
    return "UNKNOWN"

# --- Knowledge Base ---
knowledge_base = {
    "Albert Einstein": "A brilliant physicist known for the theory of relativity.",
    "Paris": "The capital of France, famous for its Eiffel Tower.",
    "Python": "A versatile programming language."
}

# --- Search Function (Using DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API - FREE & SIMPLE) ---
def search_ddg(query):  # DuckDuckGo provides good Instant Answers
    url = f"https://api.duckduckgo.com/?q={query}&format=json&pretty=1" #Pretty outputs for debugging
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        data = response.json()
        return data.get('AbstractText', None) or data.get('Answer', None) or data.get('RelatedTopics', [{}])[0].get('Text',None)  # Prioritize AbstractText, then Answer, then RelatedTopics
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error during search: {e}") #handle specific connection or http errors
        return None


# --- Main Route ---
@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def home():
    answer = None
    query = None
    source = None # To store if from knowledge or web

    if request.method == "POST":
        query = request.form["query"]
        intent = classify_intent(query)

        #Check local knowledge
        for entity, answer_local in knowledge_base.items():
          if entity.lower() in query.lower():
            answer = answer_local
            source = "Local Knowledge"
            break #exit for loop
        if answer is None: # Not in local knowledge, search.
            answer = search_ddg(query)
            if answer: #Search succeded
                source = "DuckDuckGo"
            else: #Search failed
                answer = "I am sorry, I could not find information on that topic."
                source = "None" # Indicate no source was found.

    return render_template("index.html", answer=answer, query=query, source=source)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
Phase 3: Create HTML Template (templates/index.html)

Create a folder named templates in the same directory as app.py. Inside templates, create a file named index.html:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Enigma AI Lite</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Enigma AI Lite</h1>
    <form method="POST">
        <input type="text" name="query" placeholder="Ask me anything!" value="{{ query or '' }}">
        <button type="submit">Ask</button>
    </form>

    {% if answer %}
        <h2>Answer:</h2>
        <p>{{ answer }}</p>
        {% if source %}
          <p>Source: {{ source }}</p>
        {% endif %}

    {% endif %}

    <p><em>Disclaimer: This chatbot provides information based on available sources and may contain inaccuracies.</em></p>

</body>
</html>
Phase 4: Running the Application

Save the files: Save the app.py file and the index.html file in the correct directories.
Run the Flask application:
python app.py
Access the application: Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or http://localhost:5000/.
Phase 5: Deployment (Heroku Example - Simple and Free to Start)

Create a Heroku Account: If you don't have one, sign up for a free Heroku account at https://www.heroku.com/.
Install the Heroku CLI: Download and install the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI) from https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli.
Login to Heroku:
heroku login
Create a Heroku App:
heroku create enigma-ai-lite # Replace with your desired app name
Create a Procfile: Create a file named Procfile (without any extension) in the same directory as app.py with the following content:
web: gunicorn app:app
This tells Heroku how to run your application. You'll need to install gunicorn: pip install gunicorn
Create a requirements.txt: This lists your project's dependencies. Create this file using:
pip freeze > requirements.txt
Initialize a Git Repository:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Push to Heroku:
heroku git:remote -a enigma-ai-lite # Replace with your app name if different
git push heroku master
Heroku will automatically detect that it's a Python application and install the necessary dependencies.
Open the App:
heroku open
This will open your application in your web browser.
Explanation of Key Parts:

app.py: This is the main Flask application file.
It defines the routes (/ in this case) and handles user requests.
The home() function is responsible for rendering the HTML template and processing user input.
The search_ddg() function interacts with the DuckDuckGo API to retrieve information.
templates/index.html: This is the HTML template that defines the user interface.
It includes a form for the user to enter their query.
It displays the answer returned by the chatbot.
Intent Classification: The simplified regex intent classification helps direct processing.
Knowledge Base: Provides a small local knowledge pool.
Search API: Uses the DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API, which is simpler to use and more generous than Google for quick testing. Note it may not always be as comprehensive as Google Search.
Procfile: Tells Heroku how to run the app.
requirements.txt: Lists the Python packages that Heroku needs to install.
Important Notes and Improvements:

Error Handling: The code includes basic error handling (e.g., checking for HTTP errors when making API requests), but you should add more robust error handling to make the application more reliable.
API Keys: For production use, never hardcode API keys in your code. Store them as environment variables and access them using os.environ.get(). Heroku provides a way to set environment variables.
Security: Be mindful of security best practices when deploying your application. Use HTTPS, validate user input, and protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
CSS Styling: The current HTML is very basic. Add CSS to improve the look and feel.
Alternative Search APIs: If DuckDuckGo doesn't meet your needs, you can explore other search APIs like Google Custom Search (but be aware of the costs). You will need to modify the search function accordingly.
Scaling: Heroku's free tier has limitations. If you need more resources, you'll need to upgrade to a paid plan.
Logging: Implement proper logging to track errors and monitor the application's performance.
This comprehensive guide provides a starting point for building and deploying a simplified version of Enigma AI. Remember to thoroughly test your application and address any issues that arise. Good luck! Let me know if you have any questions as you go through these steps.
